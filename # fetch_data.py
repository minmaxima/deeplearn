""" Setting Up the Cron Job
Make the Script Executable:
Ensure your script is executable. You can do this by running:

sh
chmod +x /path/to/fetch_data.py
Edit Crontab:
Open the crontab file for editing:

sh
crontab -e
Add the Cron Job:
Add a new line to schedule the script. For example, to run the script every day at 3 AM, add:

sh
0 3 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/fetch_data.py >> /path/to/fetch_data.log 2>&1
Replace /usr/bin/python3 with the path to your Python interpreter.
Replace /path/to/fetch_data.py with the full path to your script.
The >> /path/to/fetch_data.log 2>&1 part redirects the scriptâ€™s output (including errors) to a log file.
Save and Exit:
Save the changes and exit the text editor.

Notes
Environment Variables: If your script depends on specific environment variables, make sure they are set correctly within the cron job or sourced in the script itself.
Permissions: Ensure that the user running the cron job has the necessary permissions to execute the script and write to the log file.
Dependencies: If your script relies on external Python packages, ensure they are installed in the environment where the cron job runs. """
